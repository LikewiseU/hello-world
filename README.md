Hi, Grapes!
(I'm gonna call GITHUB users Grapes!)


LikewiseU on the Vineyard(nicknaming GITHUB in my way)!

I like all types of cutting-edge technology! esp; AI, and games!
Starting from this year 2021, I'm bout to start my own Vineyard farming!

Really looking foward how I will make FINE WINE.

Starting from the bottom but escalating real quick, Hang on you Grapes.
